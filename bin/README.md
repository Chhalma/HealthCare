# HealthCare
Desktop Based Health care System for Doctor's 
In this system, we can add new, update and delete new  patients and new doctors. 
It also checks doctors' availability and book appointments for patients. Upload Patients' test reports and provide reports to patients on request. 
It adds reminders and  reminds patients to book routine check-ups or tests. I have used JavaFx, Scene Builder, JDBC and MySql.
